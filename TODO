*TODO*

* configuration persistence? <-- biggest issue right now
	IPython profile config or separate file?

config_gui started -- need to actually save it, also

pseudomotor stuff

callbacks for when aliases/core traits are updated

clear up 'get-records-from-devices' and make opposite function
simple 'get-device' function (expected rtyp, ...)
