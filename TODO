*TODO*

Important:
    import ecli_plugin vs get_plugin('ECLIPlugin') is messy -- not clear
    when to use which without looking at the code.

    Similarly, there has to be a better way to have both magicargs calls 
    and functions without so much boilerplate reimplementation

    Configuration saving/loading is _very_ primitive
    (and config_gui started -- but changes not saved)

callbacks for when aliases/core traits are updated
